Introduction to The Book of Mormon 1920 Reader's Edition


This edition of The Book of Mormon is an independent presentation of the text, prepared for clarity and readability. It is based on the 1920 edition, a landmark printing that shaped the study habits of Latter-day Saints for much of the twentieth century. This edition seeks to preserve the wording and structure of that text while making it easier to read and follow.

The traditional chapter and verse numbers have been retained for reference, yet the narrative has been arranged into paragraphs that better reflect the natural flow of the material. These paragraph breaks draw influence from the 1840 edition, the last edition overseen by Joseph Smith, as well as from internal cues in the text itself. Shifts in speaker, changes in setting, transitions in discourse, and major thematic turns have been given space that the original typesetting often constricted. The purpose of these adjustments is not to alter meaning, but to present the text in a way that supports comprehension and continuity.

Certain passages that reflect clear poetic structures have also been arranged in a format that highlights their underlying Hebrew style. This includes selections from Isaiah quoted within the text and portions such as Nephi's psalm, where parallelism, repetition, and the rhythm of the lines become more apparent when displayed in poetic form. These adjustments do not alter wording, but allow the reader to experience these sections in a way that corresponds more closely to their ancient literary character.

A small number of textual refinements have been included where earlier sources indicate that the 1920 printing may have omitted words or short phrases. These restorations are supported by the printer's manuscript or by consistent readings in earlier editions such as the 1840 text. Examples include restored phrases in Mosiah and Alma that clarify the sense of the passage. These additions do not modify doctrine. They simply preserve readings that are supported by earlier versions.

A few archaic spellings have been brought into alignment with the spelling used elsewhere in the book. Words such as "burthens" and "burthensome" were updated to "burdens" and "burdensome" because the modern form already appears in other passages of the Book of Mormon itself. In every case, the wording remains faithful to the sense of the original.

This edition is not intended to replace any official publication of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Readers seeking the current authorized text should consult the editions available through the church's official website or apps. The purpose of this edition is to offer an alternative presentation of the public domain text that emphasizes readability, clarity, and careful attention to historical sources.

It is hoped that this format allows the reader to encounter the message of The Book of Mormon with fewer distractions and a greater sense of continuity across its narratives, sermons, and doctrinal teachings.
